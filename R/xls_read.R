#' Reads files from the LI-6800
#'
#' \code{xlconnect_read} Reads LI-6800 raw data files, which are delimited by tabs.
#'
#' @param path path of your data.
#' @param start_row start of measured data
#' @param S recompute by providing diffferen leaf areas, if the area does not need to change
#' , enter one single value of the  actual area, else, enter a vector of the same length
#' with the measured data. The default NULL means you do not want to change the leaf area.
#'
#' @return read_6800 imports a LI-6800 raw data file as a data frame
#' @export
