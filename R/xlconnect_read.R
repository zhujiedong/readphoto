#' Reads files from the LI-6800
#'
#' \code{xlconnect_read} Reads LI-6800 raw data files, which are delimited by tabs.

#' @param path path of your data.
#' @param start_row start of measured data
#' @param S recompute by providing diffferen leaf areas, either a single value, or
#' a vector of the same length with the measured data
#' @return read_6800 imports a LI-6800 raw data file as a data frame
